            <h3 class="title">How the Caesar Cipher Works</h3>
            <p class="content">
              The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a
              fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B'
              becomes 'E', and so on. The process is as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Select a number for the shift value (e.g., 3).</li>
              <li>Shift each letter in the plaintext by the chosen value.</li>
              <li>Wrap around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., 'Z' with a shift of 3 becomes 'C').</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cipher text is the result of applying the shift to the entire message. For instance, "HELLO" with a
              shift of 3 becomes "KHOOR".

            <p>
              The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used this cipher to protect messages of
              military significance. By shifting the alphabet, he could communicate sensitive information to his
              generals securely. This simple method of encryption was effective in its time, as most adversaries were
              not equipped to easily decrypt the messages. The Caesar Cipher represents one of the earliest known forms
              of encryption, laying the groundwork for more complex cryptographic techniques developed later.

            <h3 class="title">Cryptanalysis of the Caesar Cipher</h3>
            <p>
              Although the Caesar Cipher is simple, it is not secure by modern standards. The primary weakness of the
              Caesar Cipher lies in its limited number of possible keysâ€”only, the nummber of different shifts (excluding
              the shift by 0, which would leave the text unchanged) would be the lenght of the alphabet used. As a
              result, the cipher is vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where an attacker systematically tries all
              possible shifts until the plaintext is revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another method of breaking the Caesar Cipher is frequency analysis. In any given language, certain letters
              appear more frequently than others (for example, 'E' is the most common letter in English). By comparing
              the frequency of letters in the cipher text to the expected frequency of letters in the language, one can
              deduce the likely shift value and decrypt the message.
