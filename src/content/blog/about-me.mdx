## About Me

Hello! I'm Emil Schütt, a passionate student in Cybersecurity with a strong background in programming and a deep interest in data security. I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Engineering with a specialization in Computer Security at Blekinge Institute of Technology. In my free time, I love working on projects that involve programming, networking technologies, and experimenting with different frameworks.

## Skills

Over the years, I've developed a diverse set of skills in various areas of technology:

### Programming Languages
- Rust, C++, Python, C#, Java

### Tools & Technologies
- Docker, Git, ASP.Net, React

### Operating Systems
- Ubuntu, Fedora, Windows

### Other Skills
- Networking, Cryptography, Technical Troubleshooting

## Experience

I have worked on various projects ranging from network security tools to web development using frameworks like React and ASP.Net. I’ve also been involved in teaching programming and technical troubleshooting, helping others to understand and resolve complex technical issues. My latest focus is on Rust development, where I’ve been working on projects like RTMP protocol implementation and cryptographic libraries.
